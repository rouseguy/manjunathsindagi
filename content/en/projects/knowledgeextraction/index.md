The project dealt with the extraction of knowledge wits from documents viz. Docx, PPTx. The wits of information that is extracted corresponds to the different sections within the document.   
* Docx - Knowledge bit is defined as a section from one heading to another heading which is usually a topic within that document. However, the users do not specifically use the headers while writing the document. So, These knowledge bits were extracted using approaches like machine learning algorithm viz. svm, decision tree. There were also other approaches that considered user defined bits, header based bits etc.   
* PPTx - The knowledge bit in PPTx is defined as an individual slide. Given the pptx, it was divided into individual slides and presented to the users. The challenges was splitting the slides, extracting the images.  

These knowledge wits are further used by organizations to detect updated knowledge for example in call centers to know what solutions needs to be provided for a particular query.  
#### Impact

* Created a product that added to the portfolio of the organization.
* Ease of writing mails and other content using wits.
